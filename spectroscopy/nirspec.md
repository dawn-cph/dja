The spectra reduced so far can be found in a searchable table format found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/msaexp-nirspec/extractions/nirspec_graded.html). To obtain fits spectra, use https://s3.amazonaws.com/msaexp-nirspec/extractions/{root}/{file} with 'root' and 'file' from the table.

For pannable images with various possible layers, including HST and JWST filters as well as spectral observations, please use the "Map Viewers" menu option to the left. To see individual spectra, pan over a source with that instrument layer turned on. 

More documentation is coming soon, but for now, the spectroscopy reduction process is described in [Heintz et al., 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230600647H/abstract).
