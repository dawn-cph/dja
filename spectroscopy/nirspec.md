Here you can find various ways to access uniformly-reduced public NIRSpec datasets:

- [nirspec_graded.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/msaexp-nirspec/extractions/nirspec_graded.html): Searchable table of all public spectra reduced so far
- For pannable images with various possible layers, including HST and JWST filters as well as spectral observations, see the [Map View]({{ site.baseurl }}/general/mapview/) pages. To see individual spectra, pan over a source with the different *Spectra* overlays enabled.
- See the [nirspec-data-products]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2023/07/18/nirspec-data-products/) post for examples on working directly with the catalog and individual extracted spectra

> More documentation coming soon. The spectroscopy reduction process is described in
> [Heintz et al., 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230600647H/abstract),
> and the [msaexp](https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp) software used to process the
> spectra is freely available.
