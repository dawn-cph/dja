The [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) is involved in a number of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, but the public data can also be thought of as one comprehensive survey. The DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) is a repository of public JWST galaxy data, reduced with [grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli) and [msaexp](https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp), and released for use by anyone. 

We acknowledge the work done on the [JWST Science Calibration Pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/introduction.html), which grizli uses for the initial reduction steps. We also make use of [FITSMap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12308), developed by Ryan Hausen and Brant Robertson, for our data viewers.

## Citation Suggestions

We kindly request all scientific papers based on data or products downloaded from the Dawn JWST Archive (DJA) to include the following acknowledgement:

> (Some of) The data products presented herein were retrieved from the Dawn JWST Archive (DJA). DJA is an initiative of the Cosmic Dawn Center, which is funded by the Danish National Research Foundation under grant No. 140.

We also suggest to include references and DOIs to the grizli pipeline: [10.5281/zenodo.1146904](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146904). Basic details of the data reduction are presented in [Valentino et al., 2023.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...947...20V/abstract).

We also encourage that users acknowledge the *original program IDs and PIs* of the constituent HST and JWST datasets of the DJA data products, as well as to cite any papers those investigators have published. Please see [this table](https://grizli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grizli/image-release-v6.html) for a list of programs included in the archive so far.-->
