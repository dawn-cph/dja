The [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) is involved in a number of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) surveys, but the public data can also be thought of as one comprehensive survey. The DAWN JWST Archive (DJA) is a repository of public JWST galaxy data, reduced with [grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli) and [msaexp](https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp), and released for use by anyone. 

### Citing the DJA

We kindly request all scientific papers based on data or products downloaded from the Dawn JWST Archive (DJA) to include the following acknowledgement:

> (Some of) The data products presented herein were retrieved from the Dawn JWST Archive (DJA). DJA is an initiative of the Cosmic Dawn Center, which is funded by the Danish National Research Foundation under grant No. 140.

We also suggest to include references and DOIs to the grizli pipeline: [10.5281/zenodo.1146904](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1146904). Basic details of the data reduction are presented in [Valentino et al., 2023.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...947...20V/abstract).

Finally, we encourage that users acknowledge the *original program IDs and PIs* of the constituent HST and JWST datasets of the DJA data products, as well as to appropriately cite any papers those investigators have published. 

[This table](https://grizli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grizli/image-release-v6.html) is a recent summary of programs included in the archive so far.

Example code for calculating a summary of observing programs that contribute to a particular DJA mosaic is provided [here](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/imaging/summary/#citing-imaging-programs).

### Questions / comments ?

If you there are any topics you would like to suggest for discussion in additional pages or [posts]({{ site.baseurl}}/posts/), please consider filing an item at [https://github.com/dawn-cph/dja/issues](https://github.com/dawn-cph/dja/issues).

For questions or comments with the [eazy-py](https://github.com/gbrammer/eazy-py/issues), [grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli/issues), or [msaexp](https://github.com/gbrammer/msaexp/issues) software modules please file an <i>Issue</i> on the respective GitHub repository pages.

### Acknowledgements

We acknowledge the many developers and contributors to the [JWST Science Calibration Pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jwst/introduction.html), which we use for the initial reduction steps of both imaging and spectroscopic datasets.
