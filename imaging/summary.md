Here you will find various ways to access the imaging data:

- [v7]({{site.baseurl}}/imaging/v7/): Latest release of JWST mosaics (July 2023)
- [v6]({{site.baseurl}}/imaging/v6/): Previous release, including some HST mosaics that were not regenerated for v7.
- The [image-data-products]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2023/07/18/image-data-products/) post describes the image mosaics
- The [photometric-catalog-demo]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2023/07/14/photometric-catalog-demo/) post describes the aperture photometry catalogs derived automatically from the mosaics
- For pannable images with various possible layers, including HST and JWST filters as well as spectral observations, see the [Map View]({{ site.baseurl }}/general/mapview/) pages. To see individual spectra, pan over a source with the different *Spectra* overlays enabled.
