The images reduced in the latest (v7) release can be found [here](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/imaging/v7/), and v6 can be found [here](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/imaging/v6/). A table containing field names and program IDs can be found [here](https://grizli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/grizli/image-release-v6.html).

Science and weight images are those ending in *drz.fits.gz* and *wht.fits.gz*, respectively. Photometric catalogs with aperture correction are files ending in *phot_apcorr.fits*. To locate a particular field or type of file, use the search bar. 

For pannable images with various possible layers, including HST and JWST filters as well as spectral observations, please use the "Map Viewers" menu option to the left. To see individual spectra, pan over a source with that instrument layer turned on. 

*More documentation is coming soon, but for now, the image reduction process is described in [Valentino et al., 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...947...20V/abstract).*
